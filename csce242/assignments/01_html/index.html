        <h1>The Hypothetical Planet X</h1>
        <p><a href="../../index.html">Return to main</a></p>
        <p>
            For more than a century, there has been speculation of an undiscovered planet 
            in our solar system. This suspected planet past Neptune, dubbed Planet X, is a 
            hypothesis used to explain certain unexplainable observations in the orbits of 
            the outer planets of our solar system and small objects in the Kuiper Belt. While 
            this hypothesis fell out of popular thought, it was greatly brought back into the eye of 
            the scientific community in January 2015 when Caltech astronomers Konstantin Batygin 
            and Mike Brown premeried research based on mathmatical modeling that provides evidence 
            of an large planet in an unusual orbit in the outer solar system.

            These scientists believe the proposed ninth planet could be about the same size as Neptune 
            but with an average orbit around the sun of 20 times the distance of Neptune. Astronomers 
            predict that this celestial body would be able to be seen with today's most powerful telescopes, 
            however it would be very hard due to its faint apperance from its extreme distance from the sun. 
            Essentially, the hunt is on! There are other proposed hypotheses to explain these gravitational 
            disruptions, including the idea of a <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/is-planet-nine-a-black-hole-or-a-planet-harvard-scientists-suggest-a-way-to-find-out/">
            bowling ball sized black hole</a> left over from the big bang. While most astronomers in 2024 
            believe a Planet X to be highly unlikely, there are some out there still searching for our 
            hypothetical ninth planet.

        <ol>
            <li>September 23rd, 1846: Neptune is discovered, but gravitional  observations lead scientists to believe another planet still exists.</li>
            <li>1906: The Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona begins searching for trans-Neptunian planet which they name "Planet X."</li>
            <li>March 13th, 1930: The discovery of Pluto is announced, leading many to believe that this was Planet X.</li>
            <li>1989: Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune provided new data that recalculated its gravitiatonal effect, at the time disproving Planet X.</li>
            <li>January 2015: Caltech astronomers release new evidence of a giant, undiscovered planet in our outer solar system.</li>
