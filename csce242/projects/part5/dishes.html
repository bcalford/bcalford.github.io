                            <p>Lazy Lasagna is a deconstructed version of the classic. It's made with ground beef, store-bought sauce, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, and whatever pasta you have on hand. It's a comforting, quick, and easy recipe that is high in protein pantry staple ingredients and no need for the oven.</p>
                            <p>Lasagna is a family favorite but the tedious layering that goes into it gets old, fast. This deconstructed version is a way to enjoy this classic dish in a fraction of the time.</p>
